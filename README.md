Initial Decreme apps using Swift.

# Getting Started
Decreme is just cake order management when you run your cake shop. It helps you to track and record cake you made to your client and share them the invoice. This version is build on Swift, other version on Flutter [here](https://github.com/bphw/decreme2).

To run on your local, just type
`git clone https://github.com/bphw/decreme` and simulate on your Xcode.

This code is dedicated to [Ari Kurniawan](https://id.linkedin.com/in/ari-kurniawan-0844b51b) and his wife, [Decreme](https://www.instagram.com/decreme.id/) shop owner.
